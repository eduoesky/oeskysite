        <strong>How does this like work?</strong> <br>
        The like is automatic, that is, the like will only be given if you typed your Pou's nickname correctly! (uppercase or lowercase doesn't matter **space matters**)
        <br>
        For each email provided, 3 likes will be given. If the system receives the same email more than 3 times, the like will be denied. <br>
        <strong>Will the entered email be used to hack my Pou?</strong><br>
        No! The email is just to confirm that you are really a person (and not a robot) and to send an automatic response to your email! REMEMBERING THAT FAKE EMAILS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED (ex: ehububuu@ubeuejk.com ..) <br>
        <strong>How long does the like take? </strong><br>
        The like can take from 15 minutes to 9 hours, because of connexion. <br>
        <strong>Which Pous don't get likes?</strong> <br>Likes for TopLikes will not be given, (except if the accounts for this are forwarded through the suggestion route**)! There are also Pous banned on this site, which will never receive a like.<br>
        To avoid congestion, likes will only be given to accounts that have been used on a day after December 29, 2017.

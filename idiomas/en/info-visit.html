        <strong>How does the visit work?</strong> <br>
        The visit is automatic. The visit is, nothing more, nothing less, than my visit in the menu of your Pou, being able, you, to choose for me to send a message in your guestbook ^_^ (or not)
        <br>
        There are no limits for emails provided. Unlike the likes system, providing the email several times will not affect anything, so much so that it is optional to enter the email or not!! <br>
        <strong>How long does the visit take?</strong><br>
        Visits may take less time than likes (around 5 minutes, up to 3 hours), also depending on the connection. Visits with messages will take longer for the server to process the information. <br>
        <strong>Which Pous do not receive my visits?</strong> <br>Any Pou will receive visits! In the case of Pous banned on this site, they will not receive the visit.<br>
        To avoid congestion, visits will only be made to accounts that are active after December 29, 2017.

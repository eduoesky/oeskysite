            <strong>How is the data used?</strong> <br>
            The data provided (e.g. email) is only used to make sure you are a human and not a robot. In the case of the likes method, it exists to check how many Pous will be used for each email provided. If you exceed 3 Pous in a single email, the likes will not be given in any way. Emails can also be used to send an automated or manual response, depending on which method was sent. <br>
        <strong>Is there a danger of being hacked?</strong><br>
        No! Even though there is no danger, I advise you to put an email that is not linked to any Pou, as long as it is a real email. Fake emails are ignored by the system. In optional fields, you can simply choose not to send the email, but this does not mean that if you enter a false email, the system will accept it. <br>
        Note: regardless of whether the site has (or does not) the optional email, fake emails will be ignored.<br>

            I started playing Pou in 2012, when Pou social networks didn't exist yet. I played when I went to and from school! In 2013, when Pou's social networks were launched, I played even more, but even so, I played little at that time!
        </p>
        <p class="p-sobremim">
            My first official Pou account was Brasill55 (this account still exists today) and I played on it from 2014 until 2016, when I was hacked by an old friend of mine! I was very sad about this and I dropped Pou for a while! **I recovered this account 'Brasill55' in March of this year (2023)!
        </p>
        <p class="p-sobremim">
            While I was without an account, I created another account, called 'pou_HB20PR'. I played with a friend until November 2017, when I created another account called 'THE_INSATIABLE'. I did fake likes until I got 20k likes, and I stopped playing Pou for 2 years!
        </p>
        <p class="p-sobremim">
            I came back at the end of the year 2019, with an account called 'EndTimes'. I played with until October 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there was a bug, where players could get from 10 to 45 thousand likes per day in the game), with that, I stopped playing with 1.1 million likes and I sold my account. **That account was the former Like_x1, deleted since May of this year (2023, with 300k likes!)
        </p>
        <p class="p-sobremim">
            I came back in June 2021, a year later, practically! At that time, I made a bug, in which I managed to get fake likes and managed to reach 93 thousand likes, but on August 7, 2021, I deleted this account, because of a small error, a bug that happened because of a server error. That same day (07/08/2021), I created the OesKy account, an account that still exists today!
        </p>
        <p class="p-sobremim">
            In total I have 36 accounts; some to watch some other Pous, others I have to play with myself, creating accounts from scratch, but OesKy was the only account I use for everything, but today I play little Pou, because of my short time (and also why many friends of mine stopped playing Pou :( )!
